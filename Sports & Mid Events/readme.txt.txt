## 1. Sports & Mid Events
Whether or not you like sports, the Mid Event is a spectacle. 
There's a little something for everyone at your Mid Event party. 
Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. 
There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. 
The mid-event shows with the biggest performers in the world. The mid-event shows are spectacular.

And here, we're going to explore these shows and answer the questions like:

1.What are the most extreme outcomes of the game?
2.What's the effect of game on television viewership?
3.How over time viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved?
4.Who are the most spectacular performers in terms of mid event show performances?

While doing so we will perform:
**Data Importing & Data Cleaning
**Data Manipulation
**Data Visualization
**Expolaratory Data Analysis

We will use prominent libraries for this work from Pythons Data Science Toolkit
**pandas
**matplotlib.pyplot
**seaborn

Lets explore this dataset and find the answers for above questions and do some data analysis handson :)
